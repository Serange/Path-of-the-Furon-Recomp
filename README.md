 recomp aimed to recompile destroy all humans path of the furon


special thanks to @hedge-dev for xenonrecomp https://github.com/hedge-dev/XenonRecomp

look at the original project for info on things i dont really understand myself

It would be wise to use XenonRecomp to make your own files for the game  
----------------------------------------
follow build and usage instructions from https://github.com/masterspike52/XenonRecomp after cloning the repository


Things that need to be done
--------------------------------
implement missing functions such as audio/video drivers and whatnot as well as make the game actually run
